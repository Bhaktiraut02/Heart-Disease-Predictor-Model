# Heart Disease Predictor Model
### Project Report 
The project title is **Heart Disease prediction**. Analysing the patient’s heart disease using the data containing the dataset.
The dataset which contains of information like patients age, gender, chest pain, cholesterol level, Blood Pressure level, etc….Using this data, the heart disease will be predicted using the algorithms like support vector machine, linear regression and Gaussian Naïve Bayes the result will be taken by comparing those algorithms accuracy for the dataset.

The data will be analysed using Google Colab for python programming and Jupyter notebook compiler.

-------------------

Three steps are invloved in the completes model building and Evaluation:
- Data Preprocessing: EDA [Exploratory Data Analysis]
- Model Analysis
- Model Evaluation

-------------------

### Conclusion
The project is titles **Heart Disease prediction**. Analysing the patient’s heart disease using the data containing the dataset.
This project helps us to understand the heart disease dataset. The data is displayed in various graphical manners for better understanding. Using the linear regression, Support Vector Machine and Gaussian Naïve Bayes patients heart disease is detected by the data that are given in the dataset. The accuracy of these algorithms is Gaussian Naïve Bayes 83.52% Support Vector Machine 70.33% Linear Regression 18.75% (using the chest pain Attribute). The best result given for the dataset is from Gaussian Naïve Bayes by its accuracy.
